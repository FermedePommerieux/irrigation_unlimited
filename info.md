## Overview

This integration is for irrigation systems large and small. It can offer some complex arrangements without large and messy scripts. This integration will complement many other irrigation projects.

## Features

1. Unlimited controllers.
2. Unlimited zones.
3. Unlimited schedules. Schedule by absolute time or sun events (sunrise/sunset). Select by days of the week (mon/tue/wed...). Select by days in the month (1/2/3.../odd/even). Select by months in the year (jan/feb/mar...). Overlapped schedules.
4. Unlimited sequences. Operate zones one at a time in a particular order with a delay in between. A 'playlist' for your zones.
5. Suitable for indoor (greenhouse, hothouse, undercover areas) and outdoor (gardens, lawns, crops).
6. Hardware independent. Use your own switches/valve controllers.
7. Software independent. Pure play python.

*Practical limitations will depend on your hardware.

From release 2022.4.0 a [companion card](https://github.com/rgc99/irrigation-unlimited-card) is available. This card works well on mobile devices.
